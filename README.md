Before running this app in your mobile phones do following steps:<br>
1). Go to https://github.com/settings/developers and register this app on github. You can insert any url in fields of "HomePage url" and "Authorization callback url". It doesn't matter for this Android app. After sucessful registration github will provide you with a "Client ID" and "Cliend Secret"<br>
2). Go to your project in src/res/values/strings.xml and put the client id and client secret(both without quotes) in the fields "client_id" and "client_secret" respectively<br>
